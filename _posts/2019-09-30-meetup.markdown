This is not a lab, but rather a notification and inspirational for those
interested.

I'll be in Accra for 2 weeks between the 13th and 25th of October. And I'm not
leaving before we have had an awesome meet-up!
So my plan is to do a workshop with you on the 19th of October from 17:00.

The program for the evening is:

- Opening with Mingle, drinks, some snacks & foods
- A 1 or 2 hour workshop on the topic of "Serverless" and the creation of "serverless" programs through Typescript
- Possibility of short "lightning talks" by students, tech companies, etc.
- More mingle until we close for the evening

Take with you:

- Your laptop.
- If able come prepared with a working nodejs (version 10.0 or higher) installation as well as a nice code editor (Atom, Visual Studio Code, Sublime).
- If you have em, take some power-plugs & cables along so we can plug everyone in!

Drinks & snacks:

Taken care of, just come and have fun
