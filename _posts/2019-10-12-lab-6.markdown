Until now you have been writing JavaScript through NodeJS to make back-end apps
and webpack for the front-end. JavaScript is a pretty sweet language
with a lot of freedom. You can write your code in all kinds of fancy ways.

All that freedom is nice, but it becomes messy when your code runs into a bug.
Javascript is a run-time language too, which means that the language gets
compiled when your end-user or customer visits your site. That makes finding
bugs even harder.

When you write code in JavaScript there's nothing to stop you from writing:

```javascript
function addTwoNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

addTwoNumbers('foo', 2);
```

The code above doesn't add 2 numbers but instead glues the word `foo` and `2` 
into the weird word `foo2`, something you probably didn't intend to happen.
Sure you could write this:

```javascript
function addTwoNumbers(a, b) {
  // if a is not a number or b is not a number
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') throw "Use numbers!"
  return a + b
}
```

But that's a lot of code!

This is where today's lab starts. Today we'll be looking into the beautiful
world of Typescript.

Does this mean that we're going to learn an entire new language ðŸ˜±? Nope!
Typescript is a layer on top of JavaScript, It's basically just JavaScript with
a type-system on top providing something we call "type-safety"

New word time! Let's [Wikipedia][Wikipedia] Type-safety:

> In computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming
> language discourages or prevents type errors. A type error is erroneous or

Okay, that explanation is waay to long and waay to hard.

Type-safety basically comes down to a languages ability to prevent you from
mixing objects of different types together.

![](https://i.imgur.com/M2buzpt.png)  
A bit like a rather advanced robot preventing you from mixing red socks and a
white shirt in the laundry. Which is totally possible, but you'd hate when it
happened.

Typescript prevents you from accidentally mixing strings, numbers and 
other objects with each other in your code.

Let's go back to that code-snippet above. In that function we only
wanted numbers to be given to the function right?  
So let's do it the Typescript way:

```typescript
function addTwoNumbers(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b
}
```

From now on this function no longer takes anything else but numbers!
When we do send a string, our editor will complain and we can't turn our 
Typescript code into JavaScript code anymore until we fix the mistake.

![Boom](https://media1.giphy.com/media/2sddCIZRYfiPlNeLZn/giphy.gif)

In typescript there are however 2 gotchas:

- Typescript is a "programming language" that "compiles" to "JavaScript".
  Typescript is type-safe, but only for as long as it is Typescript.
  If an end-user sends a `string` to a function that only takes `numbers` in
  production, your code has already turned into javascript and lost its
  type-safety. So you need to "sanitize" (check) the data your users are sending
  to you.
- Plugins are not (always) type-safe. Typescript is still JavaScript and will
  allow you to import JavaScript plugins (like node-fetch). Its smart to find
  type-script `@type`-files for these plugins that give them type-safety. When
  those aren't available you need to sanitize input and output from and to these
  plugins as if they were end-users.

Anyway, waay to much talking. Let's just start.
In this lab we're going to cover the major stuff you can do with Typescript,
we'll build some small stuff and explore the different possibilities. 

## Your editor
Until now you've been using Atom editor, sublime or (Neo)Vim.
Today you are going to have 2 options. 1 easy one, 1 slightly harder.

If you are using my neovim-starter kit, there's no need to do anything as
Typescript support is already included there.

### The easy way
If you want to go the easy way, it's best to install an editor called "Visual
Studio Code". Typescript was made by Microsoft, when they designed and created
the language they made sure that their editor "visual studio code" would work
with it out of the box.
You can install Visual Studio Code here: 

[https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
On ubuntu, download the "Linux DEB" download and open it.

While Visual Studio Code comes with Typescript support out of the box, it
doesn't lint your code. For that reason make sure to install it. You can do that
through this link:

[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

### The harder Atom way

Until now we've been using ESLint with "Atom lint", That plugin is fine, but one
of the advantages we get with Typescript is that we suddenly get access to the
fast information bonus that comes with compiled languages. So we'll install a
special plugin that not only replaces our editors linter but also gives all
kinds of hints while coding.

Open up Atom and go to the settings screen (found under the "file"-menu 
on Linux or the "Atom"-menu on OSX).

Once there, go to packages, search for "linter" and disable the
`linter-ui-default` and `linter` packages if you have them.

![linter](https://i.imgur.com/Mu3BH5n.png)

You'll want to keep `linter-eslint` and friends around. These plugins will work
fine with the new "Linting" engine we're installing in a sec. ;)

Then head over to the "install" section in your Atom settings, search for
"Typescript" and install "Atom-Typescript - the only typescript plugin you'll
ever need".

If you're asked in a bubble (right-top) to install extra stuff, just hit the
"OK" button. Installation might take a while.

When that is done look for another package called "atom-ide-ui" and install that
too (this replaces the linter stuff you removed earlier).

![atom-ide-ui](https://i.imgur.com/PNeLYwT.png)

And then you're done!

## Let's "Hello World" this thing!

Now that our editor is awesome it's time to start a new project.
Open your terminal application, `cd` to the place where you keep your peojects
and add a new folder there called `ts-snippets`.

```sh
$ mkdir ts-snippets
$ cd ts-snippets
```

Now we'll install some global dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install -g typescript
```

This command will add the helper `tsc` to our computer. It will help us generate
typescript bits and execute the language

Now we need a package.json for our package stuff.

```sh
$ npm init

package name: (ts-snippets)
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
```

Cool, we'll spawn typescript as a dependency in to this project and spawn some
basic config. Today we'll not bother too much with ESLint (or TSLint as it's
called in typescript).

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev typescript
$ tsc --init
```

And we're done. Lastly we'll create a new file called `index.ts` (not `.js`!)

```sh
$ touch index.ts
```

Then open the editor. If you are rocking Visual Studio Code open your project
like this:

```sh
$ code .
```

If you're on Atom you can do the Atom thing

```sh
atom .
```

And that's it.


## Static and dynamic types
Javascript comes with 7 dynamic types:

- Undefined
- Null
- Boolean
- Number
- String
- Symbol
- Object

We've been talking about most of them in Lab 1. These so called "dynamic types"
are used when JavaScript runs (when Typescript has been turned into JavaScript).

Typescript adds a bunch of so called `static` types. These static types are used
for prediction. Static types are not evaluated at run-time (javascript) but
rather while you're still coding. They will help you by suggesting how you should
write code and they'll also warn you when you write a bug into your code.

Let's start typing some of these static types.
Open up `index.ts` in your editor and start typing the following:

```typescript
let isSomething: boolean = true;
```

Okay, we need to dissect this a bit.
When a compiler runs, the Typescript above would be turned into:


```javascript
let isSomething = true;
```

So in typescript we just add the `: boolean` bit. This is the static type.
Let's mess with it.

Try to add a new line under our previous line like this:

```
let isSomething: boolean = true;
isSomething = 'hello';
```

When you hover over the spelling-error line underneath the code with your mouse
you'll see this

![](https://i.imgur.com/dgrVs7Z.png)

We'll that's going wrong! Typescript doesn't allow us to assign a `string` to a
value that can only contain `boolean` (`true` or `false`).
Sweet eh?  
If we try to assign `false` to the variable, our linter shouldn't complain too
much.

```
let isSomething: boolean = true;
isSomething = false;
```

Let's see how this "compiles"

**Visual studio code**  
In your *Visual Studio code* editor hit `âŒ˜â‡§B` if you are on Mac OSX or `[CTRL]â‡§B` 
if you are on Linux or windows, then type `tsc`. Select the 
option `tsc build: index.ts`

![](https://i.imgur.com/5mIyRyY.png)

**Atom editor**  
In *Atom* type `âŒ˜â‡§P` on Mac OSX or `[CTRL]â‡§P` on Linux, type `typescript`. Select the
option `typescript: build`. (You can also hit the F6 key to accomplish this)

![](https://i.imgur.com/v1hwVPi.png)

**If that doesnt work or if you are using (Neo)Vim**  
Alternatively you can also write `tsc index.ts` in the terminal

A new file called `index.js` should pop up in your project. Typescript created a
JavaScript file for you from your typescript file.
Let's stay and continue working in our `index.ts` file though.

So we managed to write the static type "boolean". Let's see what other kind of 
types there are

### Boolean
We did this one already

```typescript
let isSomething: boolean = true;
```

### String
This one is pretty easy right?

```typescript
let title: string = 'Some Title';
let content: string = 'some Content';
```

We can go multi-line on our strings with back-ticks. Back-ticks can also be used
to parse information to our strings:

```typescript
const weather = 'sunyy';
const report = `
  Welcome to this evenings weather,
  The weather forecast for today seems to be ${weather}
`
```

In the above 2 examples I didn't bother adding `: string`. When you
define a variable and immediately put a string in it then Typescript will be 
smart enough to assume that `string`, will be the only type ever used on the 
variable. Neat huh? I'll explain this more a bit later!

### number
swell.

```typescript
let someDecimalNumber: number = 42;
let someBinaryNumber: number = 0b101010; // => 42
let someOctalNumber: number = 0o52; // => 42
let someHexadecimalNumber: number = 0x2a; // => 42
```

> Let's not use those last two too much though, they are confusing.

### Array
Arrays in typescript are commonly written in two ways:

```typescript
let fruits: string[] = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'];
let garageObjects: Array<string | number> = ['wrench', 42, 'hammer'];
```

We commonly use `string[]` or `number[]`, etc. when an array only contains 1
type of object.

We start to use the alternative `Array<string | number>` if an array can
contain multiple types of objects.  
This method of `<string>` is referred to as a so called "angle bracket notation"

### Tuple
When we want to work with arrays that contain a specific list of object types we
use a Tuple type.

```typescript
let couchDetails [string, number, boolean]
couchDetails = ['brown', 40, true]; // Success!
couchDetails = ['red', 40, 'something'] // will fail, the 3rd element should be a boolean
couchDetails = ['gray', 20, false, 3] // will fail, there should only be 3 elements in the array
```

### Enum
An enum is basically a list of predefined constants. Like shirt sizes:

```typescript
enum Sizes {
    Small,
    Medium,
    Large,
}

Sizes.Small; // is 0
Sizes.Medium; // is 1
Sizes.Large; // is 2
```

You can make an Enum start at a different count like this:

```typescript
enum Companies {
  Google = 1,
  Facebook,
  Twitter,
}

Companies.Google; // is 1
Companies.Facebook; // is 2
Companies.Twitter; // is 3
```

You can also assign other values to Enums


```typescript
enum Companies {
  Google = 'Google',
  Facebook = 'Facebook',
  Twitter = 'Twitter',
}

Companies.Google; // is 'Google'
Companies.Facebook; // is 'Facebook'
Companies.Twitter; // is 'Twitter'
```

### Object
We normally don't really use object, as it's better to use either Enumerables or
"interfaces". We'll dive into interfaces in a small bit.


### Any
As the name suggest, the any-type is pretty much anything you want. With Any you
can temporarily skip type-safety. If you are working on a new project, you
should probably put a rule in your `tsconfig` to block the use of the
any-object. If you are working on translating an old project from JavaScript to
Typescript, you can't really get away from using `any` types here and there from
time to time.

```typescript
let anyThing: any = 42; // assigned a number

anyThing = 'some string'; // can be reassigned to a string
anyThing = false; // can be reassigned to a boolean
```

## Void
void is when you expect something to be completely devoid of anything.
Having a variable be void would be pretty useless, but void is pretty common in
functions. Sometimes you want the result of a function to not return anything.

```typescript
function doSomething(): void {
  console.log('I write to console, but return nothing');
  return;
}

doSomething();
```

### null and undefined
these types are very much like each other:

```typescript
let anUndefinedVariable: undefined = undefined;
let aNullVariable: null = null;
let something: null = undefined;
```

These two types are however a bit special. If I were to write:

```typescript
let someString: string;
```

Then that string would be null until I actually assigned something. So by
default all of the types we've seen so far can be `null` and `undefined`.
This results into the below being a totally fine thing:

```typescript
let someString: string = null;
```

While variables can be empty when we assign them, we probably don't want to
specifically assign null to our string later. This is why it's smart to make a
rule in your project's `tsconfig` to block reassigning variables with null.

## Type inference
In many cases, you won't actually have to type the type annotation. When you
write something like this:

```typescript
let fruit = 'apple';
```

The type-system will be smart and assume that whatever you'll assign to that
fruit later will probably also be a string

This also counts for default variables in functions:

```typescript
const fruitLength = (fruit = 'Apple') => {
    return fruit.length;
};
```

The assignment of `= 'Apple'` here tells the type-system that fruit will most
likely always be a string. Aditionally since you're only returning one variable 
(the length of the fruit), which happens to come from a native JavaScript
feature, the type-system will assume that your function always returns numbers

Typescript uses the best common type inference strategy to determine types.
When you provide it with an array like this:

```typescript
someArray = [1, 2, 'someString', 3];
```

It will infer the type `Array<number | string>`, since using that would be more
common than using a tuple (`[number, number, string, number]`).
When mixing and matching object like array above, it's probably not a bad idea
to not let type interface do its magic for you. Being "explicit" is often better
than being "implicit".

## Interface
Earlier I refused to explain you how to use the type `object` in favor of
showing you something much better called `Interfaces`. Let's take a look at
them:

```typescript
interface Animal {
    kind: string;
    weight: number;
}

let dog: Animal;

dog = {
    kind: 'mammal',
    weight: 10,
}; // succeeds

dog = {
    kind: true,
    weight: 10,
}; // fails, kind should be a string
```

Additionally you can also use a `type alias` to achieve the same:

```typescript
type Animal {
    kind: string;
    weight: number;
}

let dog: Animal;

dog = {
    kind: 'mammal',
    weight: 10,
}; // succeeds

dog = {
    kind: true,
    weight: 10,
}; // fails, kind should be a string
```

They do the same thing, but have slightly different notation. Just choose
whatever you like most and stick with it in your projects. It's best to use only
one approach in your projects for the sake of consistency.

If you want to make an interface for an object you'll only use once in one
function, it's often best to just use an `inline notation` approach:

```typescript
let dog: {
    kind: string;
    weight: number;
};

dog = {
    kind: 'mammal',
    weight: 10,
}; // succeeds

dog = {
    kind: true,
    weight: 10,
}; // fails, kind should be a string
```

## Less commonly used annotations
### Generics
There can be situations where the generic type of an object doesn't matter, but
the relationship between the given object and the returned objects should be
enforced. That's when we start using Generics. Below an example:

```typescript
const fillArray = <T>(len: number, element: T) => {
   return new Array<T>(len).fill(elem);
}

const newArray = fillArray<string>(3, 'hi'); // => ['hi', 'hi', 'hi']

newArray.push('bye'); // succeeds
newArray.push(true); // fails, only strings can be added to the array
```

In the above example the generic type `<T>` gets assigned to `<String>`, but we
could have written `fillArray<Number>(3, 10)` to create a filled array that
would only allowed numbers.

### Union-type.
Sometimes we would allow objects to have 2 different types. This is when we use
the Union notation.  
A union notation works like this:

```typescript
let someValue: string | number = 'hello';
someValue = 10 // succeeds;
someValue = false // fails, only strings or numbers can be assigned.
```

### Intersection type
While in union types we would allow the use of only 1 type at the same time,
Intersection types can be used to mix and match 2 types together.

```typescript
interface Tree {
  height: number;
  kind: string;
}

interface House {
  colour: string;
}

let treeHouse: Tree & House;

treeHouse.kind = 'Oak';
treeHouse.height = 60;
treeHouse.colour = 'Blue';
treeHouse.name = 'The Fort' // fails, name does not exist on types Tree and House.
```

### Optional type
Say you're building a function, but you'd be okay if a parameter is missing
sometimes, That's when optional types are used.

```typescript
function getTrainTrip(line: number, reservedSeatNumber?: number): void {
  if (reservedSeatNumber) {
    console.log(`
    Welcome onboard of train ${line}.
    You have seat number ${reservedSeatNumber}.
    `)
  } else {
    console.log(`
    Welcome on board of train ${line}.
    You did not reserve a seat, please find a free seat in cariage 3
    `)
  }
}
```

When specifying a list of parameters in a function, it's a best practice to put
the optional parameters last.

You can also define optional variables in interfaces:

```typescript
interface Tree {
  height: number;
  kind: string;
  colour?: string;
}
```

Here, the order of required and optional variables is not so important, however 
for the sake of consistency I either sort everything alphabetically or put 
optional variables last.

## What about promises?
Promises are a bit special, A promise takes some and will then after a while come
back with a result. How would you apply Type-safety to that?
The function below will return a `Promise` that in time will return a `string`

```
function iWillWait(): Promise<string> {
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    // timeout of 2000 miliseconds resolving our promise with "Hello!"
    setTimeout( () => resolve('Hello!'), 2000 )
  })
}
```


## Final remarks
We covered a lot of ground again today and you learned an entirely "new"
programming language! Sorta...

If you feel like you don't have the hang of it yet, Google
around! The makers of the language and lots of enthusiasts have written
countless guides, labs and reviews on Typescript.

From now on, all of the future labs will base off the use of Typescript.

Next week I'll be in Accra Ghana for a presentation of Serverless. After that
we'll continue do dive into the world of React!

See you next week!
