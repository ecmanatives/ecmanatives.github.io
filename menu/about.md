Welcome to this weird little site sitting somewhere hidden in my Github profile.
The target of this site and the different labs on it is to teach a small group
of students from the Global Code programme 2019 the chops of Test Driven
JavaScript development, some react and even some react native.

Target of this project is to dive a bit into ECMAScript and the workings of
TC-39, the current existing group of lobbyists and developers that work on the 
continued development of JavaScript.  

Do some test driven development too.  

From there we'll dive a bit into the workings of React; a framework developed 
by the developers of Facebook (and a huge community of free-time GitHubbers)  

During the React stuff we'll explore some basic principles of functional 
programming (the foundation of functional JavaScript, scala, Rust, Elixir and 
a bunch of other high-speed programming languages) and Object oriented 
programming (the foundation of JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, etc.)  

Then with that done we'll branch off into react-native (JS based mobile apps) 
and Typescript.  

I'm going to write some labs, see if we can get some FaceTime. We'll figure 
it out. This stuff is going to be slightly next level and mostly focused on 
the front of things. But the principles above can be applied to other 
languages on back-end too!

The design of this site comes from [Larange][theme site] with some alterations
