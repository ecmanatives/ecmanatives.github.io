# Lab 1: The basics of Awesome!
Let's rub those hands together; after last weeks introduction and installation
it's about time we got real!

In this lab we're going to look at some of the basic constructions of the
JavaScript Language. We'll dive a bit into the different object types available
in the language, different ways to call for functions and take a look a bit 
at classes (We're doing new JavaScript magic after all!).

In this Lab we're going to cover a lot of ground. I understand it's a bit much,
but try to work through it. We need the stuff we learn here to do the rest of
the labs later. Next week is going to be a bit easier. I promise ;)

But lets start this course by making sure we got a nice editor in place that
helps us write code a bit. During this course I'll mostly look at an editor
called Atom, as it's easiest to setup and tool.

If you ended last weeks course on an older machine or if you are dealing with
a slow VirtualBox, then Atom might be a bit to "heavy" to run on your machine. 
Give me a ping and we'll get you started with "Sublime 3"

## Installing Atom.io
Atom is an editor running on JavaScript. Jep, the core of the editor is actually
running on the language we're learning! It can act like a program through the
help of a toolkit called "Electron". Atom was made by the folks that also made
GitHub!

I am boring you sorry. Let's download and install Atom.

## OSX & Windows
On OSX we need to download and install Atom from their site. 
[Go to the atom site][Atom] and download Atom for your OS.
When that's done install it and try to open it.

## Ubuntu (and VirtualBox)
Installing on Ubuntu will be done through the `Ubuntu App-get` store. The only
problem is that the normal store doesn't have Atom. So we're going to add an
extra app-source (from which the store can find & download apps) to our `apt-get`.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get -y install wget
$ wget -qO - https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/any/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/atom.list'
```

With the new "source" in our app store we can now update the list (to get the
latest shopping-lists of apps that can be installed) and install Atom.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install atom
```

That's done!

## OSX, windows and Ubuntu
With Atom installed, we got the editor working! Let's open it up and prepare the
rest.

First let's go into preferences. Once in preferences we'll go to  the
install section.

![preferences](https://i.imgur.com/xgTkaG0.png)

We'll install the following packages:

- Emmet
- linter (by Steelbrain)
- linter-eslint (there are several, use "linter-eslint")

Emmet will auto-complete some nifty things, Linter and linter-eslint will work
like spelling and grammar checks, but they will grammar and spell-check your
code!

You can also change themes in the settings here!
My faves are One Dark (which is the default), "atom-material-ui" and 
"gruvbox-dark-ui". Knock yourself out!


## Let's REPL
It's always good to take a peek at the different type of objects we can use.
It's kinda like checking what kind of hammers, saws and screw-drivers you have
in your toolbox.

Open a new terminal screen and execute the command below to pop into a 
NodeJS REPL shell.

```sh
$ node
```

We'll type some fun commands to get started.

```javascript
> "hello  World!"
'hello world'

> typeof "hello world!"
'string'
```

That's kinda funny isn't it? When NodeJS sees a boring `string` (strings without
special bits and bops) it will actually prefer you to put them between single
quotes. Let's keep that in mind for the future.

Lets try some other basic types:

```javascript
> typeof true
'boolean'

> typeof false
'boolean'

> typeof 1
'number'

> typeof 1.1
'number'

> typeof [1, 2]
'object'

> typeof {}
'object'

> typeof function() {}
'function'

> typeof class Testing {}
'function'
```

Okay, some weird things are happening here. 

- both `1` and `1.1` are called [number][Number]. So in types we don't care too much
  about numbers being `float` (remember python?) or `integers`.
- both `[]` and `{}` have the type of 'object'. This is a bit misleading though 
  as `[]` is still officially called an `Array` (and receives the [special 
  functions from Array][Array]).
- A class is actually a cool looking function? Jep, It does however get some
  extras, but we'll dive into that later.

It's good to remember that arrays are `index`-based, this means that the first
item in an array is actually the 0th item. Let's test that.

```javascript
> ['first', 'second'][0]
'first'
> ['first', 'second'][1]
'second'
> ['first', 'second'].length
2
```

So we have object 0 and object 1, but the list has a length of 2 items.

![wat](https://media0.giphy.com/media/xThuW4BaAA2f7nRvoc/giphy.gif)

Sure, lets look at objects then!

```javascript
> let thing = { hello: 'world', someNumber: 42 }
undefined
> thing
{ hello: 'world', someNumber: 42 }
> thing.hello
'world'
> thing.someNumber
42
```

Cool, so we can store bits and pieces of information in objects!
Unlike mutable languages you can actually overwrite some things.
Let's take that object from earlier and change something

```javascript
> thing.hello = 'world!'
'world'
> thing
{ hello: 'world!', someNumber: 42 }
```

That's a bit creepy huh? One part of your code can actually change something
that was created earlier. It's fine to do those kind of things, but you need to
make sure you name your functions and code in such a way, that it's easy to
understand why and where the "state" of objects are changed.

> Did you see me putting a whitespace between `{` and `hello:`?   
> It's good to put a bit of breathing space between things here and there!

Now without you actually noticing it, we used another piece of special code
above. Did you see the `let` I used there?  
**When you define a variable name for the first time, you need to prefix 
it with either `let` or `const`**. Back in the days of ECMA 3 we only had 
`var` (you shouldn't use that anymore). But `let` and `const` are much better.

Let's experiment with them:

```javascript
> let foo = 'test 1'
undefined
> foo
'test 1'
> foo = 'test 2'
'test 2'
> foo
'test 2'

> const bar = 'test 1'
undefined
> bar
'test 1'
> bar = 'test 2'
Thrown:
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

AHA!!! So when you define a variable with let, you are allowed to "re-assign" it
with an entirely different value later, but when  you use `const` you can't.  
That's handy when you don't want variables that shouldn't change to change.

## If, else, else if
Like pretty much any  other language JavaScript supports conditions. Let's try
some:

```javascript
> if ('hello' === 'hello')  { console.log('HELLO!' }
HELLO!

> if ( 1 === 2 ) { 'possible!' } else { 'impossible!' }
impossible!

> if ( '1' === 1 ) { 'possible!' } else if (1 === 1) { 'impossible!' }
impossible!

> if ( '1' == 1 ) { 'same content, different types, but it works!' }
same content, different types, but it works!

> if ( !false )  { 'false with a ! is false upside down and thus true' }
false with a ! is false upside down and thus true

> if ( 10 <= 100 ) { '10 is less than or equal to 100' }
10 is less than or equal to 100

> if ( 'something' ) { "anything that isn't false or undefined is actually 'truthy'" }
anything that isn't false or undefined is actually 'truthy'
```

So these are the different If statements you can use. Do you see the important
difference between `===` and `==`?

-  `==` will evaluate to true when 2 objects have the same content, but it
   won't care about the different types of those objects.
- `===` will  evaluate to true when 2 objects have the same content and are of
  the same type.

Generally we never really use `==`.

An `if` statement will resolve "truthy" when it receives true or anything that
isn't `false`, `null` or `undefined`. So  you don't need to try to always get 
a `true`.

So far you've seen some `if` `else` and `if else`. But there's an extra one.  
The **Conditional ([ternary][Ternary]) operator**. It looks like this:

```javascript
condition ? "when truthy" : "when falsy";
```

It works like this:

```javascript
> let tester = 'hello';
> tester ? tester : 'no tester';
'hello'
```

## We need to go deeper! Let's do functions
Okay, so we got a basic idea of JavaScripts Types now. There are a few more,
but we won't cover them today.

Let's see if we can execute some functions, write some callbacks and create some
classes. It's pretty bad to do that in a REPL however so let's start using that
editor of ours!

Let's exit the REPL (you  can also hit `ctrl` + `c` twice).

```javascript
> .exit
```

Now it would be handy to have a folder reserved to our JavaScript stuff. Let's
go to the home-folder, create a dev folder and put a folder in that called
`ecma-natives` with a `lab-1` folder inside. In that folder we'll put a new file
called functions.js

```sh
$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p dev/ecma-natives/lab-1/
$ cd dev/ecma-natives/lab-1/
$ touch functions.js
```

Cool. Before we continue let's start some version control. In this lab we're
going to create some functions and play with them. It'd be nice if you could
scroll back in time later to see the different function options we went through.

```sh
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
```

> If this is the first time you do git stuff on your computer, you might need to
> set your username and email address. Just follow the instructions in the error
> that was raised. (it will say something like `git config --global user.name`).
> Make sure to fill in your real name and a valid email address. The combo will
> be your copyright and proof of ownership of the code you  write in the future.

Cool, our code is safe! Let's open the current folder in atom (or sublime).
Don't forget the dot in the end of the command. A `.` means "do something with
the current  directory"

```sh
$ atom .
```

![Atom](https://i.imgur.com/mO1U9wK.png)

Sweet! Now let's open our functions.js from the left sidebar in Atom.
We'll start with an easy function.

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('world!')
}
```

Now if we save this file and execute it from the console, it's not going to do
much. It looks like that function isn't running at all!

```sh
$ node functions.js
```

We have just defined our function, but we'll still need to call it somewhere.
Let's add an extra line to our code then

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('world!');
}

hello();
```

Save it and execute it!

```sh
$ node functions.js
world!
```

Sweet!, what would happen if we didn't actually add those () on our function
call?

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('world!');
}

hello;
```

```sh
$ node functions.js
```

Ah, so when we pass around a function and don't add the `()` yet, the function
won't actually run yet. That's good to know.

Let's play with arguments next

```javascript
function hello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello ${ name }`);
}

hello("Peter");
```

```sh
$ node functions.js
Hello Peter
```

So an argument is parsed between the `()`, like in pretty much any programming
language you've used so far. What's going on with `Hello ${ name }`?

Up till ECMAScript 3 we'd use constructions like this to add 2 strings to each
other:

```javascript
'hello ' + name;
```

With ECMAScript 2015 we got the ability to do these kind of things using
a so called [template literal](Template literal). A template literal consists
out of two important bits:

- It doesn't have `"` or `'` surrounding it, but a so called backtick `` ` ``.
- It needs templates (bits of executing code) between `${  }`

Template literals aren't supported by Internet Explorer at all, so you'll need
to transpile this bit if you ever use it out in the wild. But all of that's is 
for later concern.

Let's do two more things before we wrap it up for this week:

- Default values
- Returned values

Like in many languages JavaScript supports the use of default values in function
calls. It works a bit like this:

```javascript
function hello(name, country  = 'Ghana') {
  console.log(`Hello ${ name } from ${ country }`);
}

hello(name);
```

When you run this you'll see:

```sh
$ node functions.js
Hello Peter from Ghana
```

Neat! It's important to remember that optional arguments last. 
If you are dealing with a lot of optional arguments, it's better to instead call
the function with an object like so:

```javascript
function printDetails(person) {
  age = (person.age ? person.age : 0);
  country = (person.country ? person.country : 'Ghana');

  console.log(`Hello ${ person.name } from ${ country } with age ${ age } years`);
}

printDetails({ name: 'peter', age: '29' });
```

When we run this we get:

```sh
$ node functions.js
Hello Peter from Ghana with age 29 years
```

The function we wrote so far does 2 things:
- It combines values into a string.
- It prints that string to our terminal.

It's often much better if a function is really good at doing only one or two
things. Let's see if we can move that console.log out instead.


```javascript
function printDetails(person) {
  age = (person.age ? person.age : 0)
  country = (person.country ? person.country : 'Ghana')

  `Hello ${ person.name } from ${ country } with age ${ age } years`;
}

message = printDetails({ name: 'peter', age: '29' });
console.log(message)
```

When we save and run this we'll see the following:


```sh
$ node functions.js

```

Hey, what happened? Well the function we ran didn't actually return anything.
Let's fix that.

```javascript
function printDetails(person) {
  age = (person.age ? person.age : 0)
  country = (person.country ? person.country : 'Ghana')

  return `Hello ${ person.name } from ${ country } with age ${ age } years`;
}

message = printDetails({ name: 'peter', age: '29' });
console.log(message)
```

When run: 

```sh
$ node functions.js
Hello peter from Ghana with age 29 years
```

Awesome. Let's do something weird:

```javascript
function printDetails(person) {
  age = (person.age ? person.age : 0)
  country = (person.country ? person.country : 'Ghana')

  return `Hello ${ person.name } from ${ country } with age ${ age } years`;
  console.log('You made it here boss!!!')
}

message = printDetails({ name: 'peter', age: '29' });
console.log(message)
```

When we run this, that extra "You made it here boss!!!" isn't shown:

```sh
$ node functions.js
Hello peter from Ghana with age 29 years
```

So when you return, you stop a function from executing from that point on as
well! We can use that.

```javascript
function printDetails(person) {
  if (!person.name) { return 'you forgot the name' }

  age = (person.age ? person.age : 0)
  country = (person.country ? person.country : 'Ghana')

  return `Hello ${ person.name } from ${ country } with age ${ age } years`;
  console.log('You made it here boss!!!')
}

message = printDetails({ age: '29' });
console.log(message)
```

When we run this we see:

```sh
$ node functions.js
you forgot the name
```

Stopping functions from executing this way is called `guard clausing`.

You can simplify the above even more if you want. The following two lines both
stop and return the code.

```javascript
if (!person.name) { return 'you forgot the name'; }
if (!person.name) return 'you forgot the name';
```

When you deal with if-statements on a single line you can actually just leave
out the function body marking `{  }`. This is only  possible from ECMAScript
2015 onward though.

## Git away
It's good to commit this work now, You've been creating a file with some
function logic. It's good to commit that (and possibly even put it on Github) so
you  can look at these things later when you forget how something worked 
(happens to me all the time!).

So open up your terminal, `cd` to the project and do something like this:

```javascript
git add .
git commit -m "Adding some functions"
```

## Final remarks
You made it through todays lab! Go to WhatsApp and post something like "lab 1 is
done!" for eternal glory (and my ability to see if I'm not making things too
complicated). 

We covered a lot of ground though and maybe you want to read a bit more. It's
not actually bad to try this lab 2 times. I've also hidden links to more
examples when I mentioned hard-to-understand words in a few different places. 
Feel free to check them out.

Next week we'll dive into advanced objects and classes. See you next week!
